SectorFileCreator
=================

##Goals
The goal of this application is to be able to just click run, fill in some data, and then the program after probably a half hour to hour of running, will spit out the majority of a VRC sector file, completely up to date.
Maybe we could even add some options for other programs, such as Euroscope or vSTARS

##Contributing
Fork and pull request is the best way, anything you want to do is appreciated.
If you don't know how to program, but want to make suggestions- open an issue, and I'll address it as soon as I can.

##Requirements

This definitely requires a good internet connection.

##Unit Testing

Unit test everything- debugging takes forever with 300MB kind of files.
